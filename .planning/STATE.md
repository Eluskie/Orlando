## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from requirements following Foundation -> Chat -> Extraction -> Canvas -> Generation -> Integration order
- [Roadmap]: Style extraction before canvas (can't display what doesn't exist)
- [Roadmap]: Cost controls in Phase 1 (prevent expensive mistakes during development)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Style extraction JSON schema needs design during Phase 3 planning
- [Research]: Imagen API integration patterns need research during Phase 5 planning
- [Research]: SVG export may not be feasible (AI outputs PNG) - may need high-res PNG alternative
